# Reliability and Stability of Elementary Reading Attitude Survey (ERAS) Scores Across Gender, Race, and Grade Level
The objective of this project is to refine and cleanse unmatched responses from the Elementary Reading Attitude Survey. Addditional, calculate various forms of statistical reliability and correlation across gender, race, and grade level. This project contains elements of data cleansing, validation, and analysis.

This analysis assesses several types of reliability including: 
1. Test-Retest
2. Alternate
3. Internal Consistancy
4. Split-half 

Methods of ** Pearson Correlation ** and ** Chronbach's Alpha ** are applied to different subsets of the data to measure reliability.
